              <h5>Designing a Culture of Design </h5>
              <p>Workplace culture doesn&#8217;t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn&#8217;t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It&#8217;s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it&#8217;s what stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.</p>
              <p>In Aaron&#8217;s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have that others don&#8217;t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace&#8217;s culture. Once you&#8217;ve worked within a culture of design it&#8217;s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</p>
              <h5>About Aaron</h5>
              <p>Aaron Irizarry is a Senior Product Designer for Nasdaq OMX, a lover of heavy metal, a foodie, and a master of BBQ arts. You can find some of his thoughts and presentations on the conversation surrounding design over at <a>discussingdesign.com.</a></p>

              <h5>Lights! Camera! Interaction! Design Inspiration from Filmmakers</h5>
              <p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It&#8217;s the filmmaker&#8217;s job to put this together. To do so they&#8217;ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told story.</p>
              <p>With this workshop, we&#8217;ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We&#8217;ll look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We&#8217;ll consider why they&#8217;re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.</p>
              <h5>About Adam</h5>
              <p>Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about collaboration, communication, creativity and storytelling. As an Experience Design Director with Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ years of experience in interaction and experience design with a background in computer science, film, and animation to create effective and easy-to-use digital products and services. He believes that no matter how utilitarian a tool is, at the core of its creation lies a story; uncovering that story is key to its success. Occasionally, he shares his perspectives on design at <a>adamconnor.com</a> and <a>discussingdesign.com.</a></p>

              <h5>Leveling Up with Flexbox </h5>
              <p>By now, you&#8217;ve probably heard of &#8220;flexbox,&#8221; short for the CSS Flexible Box Layout module and the most fully developed and well supported of CSS3&#8217;s wide array of new layout mechanisms. Flexbox allows you to create fluid, responsive layouts without having to worry about all those pesky float layout quirks we&#8217;ve dealt with for over a decade. But with cross-browser support still incomplete, you&#8217;ve probably relegated flexbox to the &#8220;one day&#8221; pile of web design tricks.</p>
              <p>It&#8217;s time to stop waiting. In this talk, Zoe aims to convince you that it&#8217;s a good idea to start learning and using flexbox today. You&#8217;ll learn how to take your designs—and web design skills—to the next level as we use flexbox as practical progressive enhancement, adding it in bits and pieces on individual page components with graceful fallbacks.</p>
              <h5>About Zoe</h5>
